			"message": "My dearest fanfan, fiona, flimflom, funfun, fonfon, flingflong, fionafiona, walmart daph, khaleesi, 110, burp girl, international space station, stepsis, joey’s business partner, punisher of porcelain, destroyer of toilets and of course my favorite thing to call you: Queen.\n\nHappy 2 years anniversary, I’m quite Sadge I wasn’t there from the start. But my Queen, I wish to thank you for all the hours of laughs you’ve given me. a mere pixel as me, thank you for accepting me into the onlyfanfans, the bests community on Twitch and the hardest working streamer on the platform (24 hours stream with 80% of hachu clips showed us this) … when you stream. \n\nYou got on my scope/list I gifted 10 subs and you did a handflip (?) during a Yuggie stream, and when you called me whorebu for mocking you splitting a shot. You got me hooked when I was giggling like a little girl at “savage mode” (video attached) and from that moment, I knew I had found the right Queen to queen.\n\nI’d like to thank you with a motivational speech, but I don’t know what to say, really. I know the three minutes before every stream is the biggest battle of your life – will the pixels enjoy my stream? Will I be funny enough? Will wibuge be there? My Queen, you can sit and talk to the monitor and you would still mesmerize the 1800 viewers with your beauty, agility, nubility and fertility, #neverchange fanfan.\n\nBut remember you’re not alone, we watch your stream as a community, like we watched Modern Family over and over the times you fell asleep fanfKEKW . \nWe’re onlyfanfans, gentle-men and women, believe me. We as pixels can stay on the stream and get the ads shown to us by twitch and banned by their S OMEGALUL Y women policies or we can fight our back into the stream, we can climp out of this twitch ads-hell, one sub at a time. (GET REKT TWITCH)\n\nNow, I can’t do it for you. I’m too old. I look around. I see these young pixels, and I think -- I mean -- I made every wrong choice a middle-aged pixel can make. I, uh, I pissed away all my money on the Queen and fake streamers, believe it or not. I chased off anyone who’s ever given me attention in twitch chat. And lately, I can’t even stand to look at the pixel I see in the monitor.\n\nYou know, when you get old in life things get taken from you. I mean that's...part of life. But you only learn that when you start losing stuff. You find out life’s this game of inches. So is streaming. Because in either game, life or just chatting streams, the margin for error is so small -- I mean one-half a step too late, or too early, and you don’t quite make it. One-half second too slow, too fast, you don’t quite catch it.\n\nThe inches we need are everywhere around us.\n\nThey’re in every break of the stream, every minute, every second.\n\nYour loyal pixel,\nWibuge\n\nP.S. I didn’t use grammerly, I’m too poor to buy it, so blow me.\n\nP.P.S Also non-subbed pixels, please sub to fanfan with prime or with twitch sub – she’s really the one of the only streamers on the platform who deserves the subs if you ask whorebulge.\n",
