"10/21/2022 4:08:50","Day 730 of nonstop finfon content and im starting to lose track of how long I’ve been trapped here… my only wish is that my family never finds out my search history is full of cringe phrases like “fanfan caught sucking toes” or “toilet gets destroyed by fanfan”or “fanfan slurps burps” PainsChamp . I shouldve read the bio before subbing but I was jebaited and now I cant go back to being a regular pixel. I miss the days when I could just watch, chat, coom and repeat COPIUM . No other content can do it for me anymore I am addicted to cringe now and its all thanks to flimflom Smadge . My days are spent edging about whether or not she actually wants to fuck her brother or if she really wants to rope obese people off and I cant take it anymore peepoRiot . I NEED ANSWERS! is she a titty streamer or not a titty streamer? does she actually watch anime or does she just remember the opennings? is she really cracked at apex or not? IS SHE EVEN CHINA?! the conspiracy theories never end with finfon and I cant stop watching FeelsBadMan ","https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FDLsz_EmwNuorOMTHM8AUSgc1LxGXqay","milkncropdust"

"10/20/2022 10:46:23","My dearest fanfan, fiona, flimflom, funfun, fonfon, flingflong, fionafiona, walmart daph, khaleesi, 110, burp girl, international space station, stepsis, joey’s business partner, punisher of porcelain, destroyer of toilets and of course my favorite thing to call you: Queen.

Happy 2 years anniversary, I’m quite Sadge I wasn’t there from the start. But my Queen, I wish to thank you for all the hours of laughs you’ve given me. a mere pixel as me, thank you for accepting me into the onlyfanfans, the bests community on Twitch and the hardest working streamer on the platform (24 hours stream with 80% of hachu clips showed us this) … when you stream. 

You got on my scope/list I gifted 10 subs and you did a handflip (?) during a Yuggie stream, and when you called me whorebu for mocking you splitting a shot. You got me hooked when I was giggling like a little girl at “savage mode” (video attached) and from that moment, I knew I had found the right Queen to queen.

I’d like to thank you with a motivational speech, but I don’t know what to say, really. I know the three minutes before every stream is the biggest battle of your life – will the pixels enjoy my stream? Will I be funny enough? Will wibuge be there? My Queen, you can sit and talk to the monitor and you would still mesmerize the 1800 viewers with your beauty, agility, nubility and fertility, #neverchange fanfan.

But remember you’re not alone, we watch your stream as a community, like we watched Modern Family over and over the times you fell asleep fanfKEKW . 
We’re onlyfanfans, gentle-men and women, believe me. We as pixels can stay on the stream and get the ads shown to us by twitch and banned by their S OMEGALUL Y women policies or we can fight our back into the stream, we can climp out of this twitch ads-hell, one sub at a time. (GET REKT TWITCH)

Now, I can’t do it for you. I’m too old. I look around. I see these young pixels, and I think -- I mean -- I made every wrong choice a middle-aged pixel can make. I, uh, I pissed away all my money on the Queen and fake streamers, believe it or not. I chased off anyone who’s ever given me attention in twitch chat. And lately, I can’t even stand to look at the pixel I see in the monitor.

You know, when you get old in life things get taken from you. I mean that's...part of life. But you only learn that when you start losing stuff. You find out life’s this game of inches. So is streaming. Because in either game, life or just chatting streams, the margin for error is so small -- I mean one-half a step too late, or too early, and you don’t quite make it. One-half second too slow, too fast, you don’t quite catch it.

The inches we need are everywhere around us.

They’re in every break of the stream, every minute, every second.

Your loyal pixel,
Wibuge

P.S. I didn’t use grammerly, I’m too poor to buy it, so blow me.

P.P.S Also non-subbed pixels, please sub to fanfan with prime or with twitch sub – she’s really the one of the only streamers on the platform who deserves the subs if you ask whorebulge.
